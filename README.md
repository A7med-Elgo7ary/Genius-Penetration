# 🤖 AI-PenTest Agents: Autonomous Penetration Testing System

> *A Multi-Agent AI-Powered Penetration Testing Framework for Automated Ethical Hacking — Built for Kali Linux 2025*

🚀 **AI-PenTest Agents** is an advanced, autonomous penetration testing system that leverages artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and large language models (LLMs) to automate key stages of ethical hacking. Designed as a modular multi-agent architecture, it streamlines reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, exploitation, post-exploitation, reporting, and blue team defense — all while maintaining intelligent decision-making and adaptive workflows.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

This system mimics a full Red Team engagement by autonomously performing cybersecurity assessments across multiple attack surfaces. Each agent handles a specific phase of penetration testing using industry-standard tools and AI-enhanced logic, ensuring efficiency, accuracy, and adaptability in identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities.

It’s built with Python, integrates seamlessly into Kali Linux 2025, and supports both rule-based and AI-powered strategies for red teaming, purple teaming, and defensive analysis.

## 🧠 Key Features

- ✅ **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Modular design with independent agents for each penetration testing phase.
- 🧵 **Intelligent Orchestration**: Powered by Reinforcement Learning (Stable-Baselines3) or LLMs like GPT & Claude.
- 🛠️ **Tool Integration**: Uses Nmap, Metasploit, SQLMap, OWASP ZAP, Shodan, Sublist3r, Empire, Wazuh, and more.
- 📊 **Vulnerability Prioritization**: ML-driven CVE risk scoring and exploit prediction.
- 🛡️ **Blue Team Counterpart**: Real-time anomaly detection, threat correlation, and automated response simulation.
- 📄 **Automated Reporting**: Generates interactive HTML, JSON, and PDF reports with visual dashboards.
- 🧬 **Adaptive Exploitation**: Auto-selects exploits based on scan results and fingerprint data.
- 🔄 **Purple Team Ready**: Combines offensive and defensive capabilities in one unified framework.

## 🧪 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Kali Linux 2025 (or any Linux system with Python 3.10+)
- Docker (for containerized components)
- Internet access for API keys (Shodan, VirusTotal, OpenAI, Gemini )

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-PenTest-Agents.git
cd AI-PenTest-Agents
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env  # Configure API keys in .env file
```

### Usage

```bash
python main.py --target example.com
```

You can also use the Streamlit dashboard for interactive control:

```bash
streamlit run agents/reporting_agent/ui/streamlit_dashboard.py
```
